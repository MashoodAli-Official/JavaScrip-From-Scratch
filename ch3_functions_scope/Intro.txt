1. 👉👉Functions👈👈
Functions are reusable blocks of code designed to perform specific tasks. They help in 
organizing and structuring your code, making it easier to read and maintain.

Types of Functions
1️⃣ Named Functions: These functions have a name and can be called anywhere in the code. 
They are declared using the function keyword, followed by the function name and parameters.

2️⃣ Anonymous Functions: These functions don't have a name and can only be used as callbacks 
or assigned to variables. They are declared using the function keyword, followed by the 
parameters and the function body.

3️⃣ Immediately Invoked Function Expressions (IIFEs): These functions are executed immediately
 after their declaration. They are created using the function keyword, followed by the 
 parameters and the function body, and enclosed in parentheses.

4️⃣ Arrow Functions: These functions are a concise syntax for writing anonymous functions. 
They use the => arrow token, followed by the parameters and the function body.

2. 👉👉Scopes👈👈
Scopes determine the visibility and accessibility of variables and functions in your code. 
There are three types of scopes in JavaScript:

1️⃣ Global Scope: Variables and functions declared outside of any function or block are 
accessible from anywhere in the program.

2️⃣ Function Scope (Local Scope): Variables and functions declared within a function are only 
accessible within that function. They are not accessible outside of the function they are 
defined in.

3️⃣ Block Scope: Variables declared within a block (e.g., inside an if statement or a for 
loop) are only accessible within that block. Block scope was introduced in ES6 
(ECMAScript 2015) using the let and const keywords.
