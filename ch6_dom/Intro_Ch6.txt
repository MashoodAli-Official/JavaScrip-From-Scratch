DOM IN JAVASCRIPT
A simple definition of the DOM (Document Object Model) is that it's a programming 
interface provided by web browsers that represents web documents as a hierarchical 
tree structure. Each node in the tree represents an element, attribute, or piece 
of text in the document, allowing programming languages like JavaScript to 
interactively access, manipulate, and update the content, structure, and style of 
web pages.
