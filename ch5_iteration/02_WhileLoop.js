// ðŸ‘‡ðŸ‘‡ WHILE LOOP
// A while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the specified 
// condition is true.

let i = 0;
while (i < 10){
    console.log('This is while loop');
    i++;
};

// In this ðŸ‘†ðŸ‘† example:
// The loop runs as long as i is less than 10.
// The statement inside the loop prints the current value of i.
// We increment i by 1 in each iteration to prevent an infinite loop.
