**ITERATION INTRODUCTION**
In JavaScript, iteration refers to the process of executing a block of code 
repeatedly for a set number of times or while a certain condition holds true. 
This is typically done using loops. 
There are several ways to implement iteration in üëá JavaScript:

1Ô∏è‚É£ for Loop: The for loop is one of the most common ways to iterate through a range of values. 
It takes three expressions: the initialization, the condition, and the final expression that 
is evaluated at the end of each loop iteration.

2Ô∏è‚É£ while Loop: A while loop continues to execute a block of code as long as the specified 
condition is true.

3Ô∏è‚É£ do-while Loop:
Unlike the while loop, a do-while loop will execute the block of code once before checking 
if the condition is true, then it will repeat the loop as long as the condition is true.
 
4Ô∏è‚É£ for-in Loop:
The for-in loop is used to iterate over the enumerable properties of an object.

5Ô∏è‚É£ for-of Loop:
The for-of loop is used to iterate over iterable objects like arrays, strings, maps, 
node lists, and more. It iterates over the values of an iterable object.

6Ô∏è‚É£ Array.forEach Method:
This method is specifically for arrays, and it allows you to execute a function on each item in the array.
